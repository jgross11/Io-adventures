The contents of this folder are as follows:

-LinkedList.io: a working implementation of a simple linked list
-Node.io: a working implementation of a simple node
-Tester.io: the file that contains all methods necessary to run a test, including assertTrue, assertFalse, and assertEquals
-TestLinkedList.io: a file that contains tests to run (using Tester.io) that test the implementation of LinkedList.io and Node.io

Due to the simplicity of Io, a dense description of each file is unnecessary - each file contains many comments, and the code itself
is relatively simple to understand. For more information regarding the workings of each file, simply view their code.
